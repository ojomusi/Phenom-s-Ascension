Put my entire story into a third-person perspective without removing any of the content or detail. For decisions, make whatever decision I made canon to what Joel did.


Make this story into an HTML5 beat-em-up sidescroller/vertical scroller game called Phenom's Ascension that looks like Streets of Rage. Use art based on the characters. Make levels/stages based on the story and its chapters. The user has 3 lives. Use particle and aura special effects and have the primary colors be based on the story. 
Score increases when you defeat an enemy, get past an enemy, or finish a level.
Use art sprites and animation based on the characters in the story and have them all be of the same style.
The beginning of the game, ending of the game, and the levels should each have text from the story explaining what's going on.
