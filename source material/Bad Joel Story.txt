Bad Joel Story
**Title: **The Fall of the Hunter King

**Prologue: The Making of a Rogue**

Joel was not born into power, nor did he seek it. At twenty-two, a skilled but unnoticed rogue in New York City’s underworld of Hunters, he had no illusions about the world he lived in. It was a world ruled by men like Elias Kain, a world where the strong devoured the weak, and the shadows were filled with more than just monsters. When the opportunity arose to become something greater, Joel took it—not out of ambition, but out of necessity.

Armed with a shortbow and a keen mind, he carved his path not through brute strength, but through deception, strategy, and precision. He did not rush blindly into battle like others. He learned to strike where it hurt the most.

### **Character Profiles:**

**Joel** – A rogue-class warrior specializing in stealth, deception, and precision strikes. Armed with a shortbow and various gadgets, he relies on strategy over brute force. His journey transforms him into a legendary figure in the Hunter world.

**Naomi** – A hacker and intelligence expert. She provides Joel with technological support, breaking through firewalls, intercepting enemy communications, and ensuring their team always has the upper hand.

**Dante** – A melee combat specialist, trained in dual-wielding daggers and close-quarters combat. A thrill-seeker who thrives in the chaos of battle.

**Mira** – A former Association Hunter who turned against Kain after witnessing his atrocities. She specializes in sniper support and battlefield tactics.

**Ghost** – A silent infiltrator with enhanced vision. Works best in the shadows, eliminating threats before they see him coming.

**Elias Kain** – The primary antagonist, leader of the Hunter Association, and mastermind behind Project NOX. His desire for absolute control leads him to experiment on himself, making him the final and deadliest obstacle.

**The Alpha** – Leader of the Iron Fangs, a powerful and brutal warrior who becomes an invaluable ally in the war against Kain.

### **Chapter One: Breaking the Chains**

The moment everything changed was the moment Joel refused to abandon Graves. The Hunter Association had marked the man as a failed experiment, a mistake that needed to be erased. But Joel saw something else: a victim of the same system that had crushed so many before him. With a carefully planned infiltration, Joel extracted Graves from the Association’s grasp, marking his first act of open defiance.

But the Association did not forgive, and it did not forget.

#### **Meeting Dante Cross**

Before the war against Kain truly began, Joel met Dante Cross on a mission gone horribly wrong. A high-value Association target had been marked for execution, but Joel—working alone at the time—was outnumbered and nearly overwhelmed. Dante, who had been hunting the same target for personal reasons, intervened at the last moment, cutting down the enemy with brutal efficiency.

Afterward, the two formed an uneasy alliance, recognizing in each other the same relentless drive to bring down the corrupt system. Where Joel was calculated and methodical, Dante was chaos incarnate, thriving in unpredictability. They were opposites, but together, they became something dangerous.

#### **The Mission Where Joel Met Naomi**

Naomi entered Joel’s life during a high-stakes infiltration into a secure data vault beneath an abandoned subway station. Joel had planned the mission down to the second—disabling security, neutralizing guards, extracting intel. What he didn’t expect was that someone else was already inside.

Naomi had broken into the facility on her own, accessing the mainframe before Joel even reached it. The two crossed paths mid-hack, each realizing the other wasn’t Association. What should have been a silent conflict turned into a forced partnership when security detected the breach. Working together, Joel and Naomi barely escaped, with Naomi proving her skills by rerouting security lockdown protocols just in time.

Afterward, Joel knew he couldn’t take on the Hunter Association alone. Naomi became his digital eyes and ears, feeding him intelligence that turned the tide of his war.

#### **Game Decision:**
- **Option 1:** Escape undetected, avoiding combat while hacking into the main server.
- **Option 2:** Fight through security forces, eliminating key threats before extracting the data.

With stolen data in hand, Joel didn’t just leak the files. He *burned* them into the public consciousness. Within hours, the world knew what the Association had done. Within days, the Association’s grip on power began to crack.

### **Chapter Two: Assembling an Army**

Exposing the truth was not enough. Kain and his loyalists were still in power, and they were prepared to fight for their empire. Joel needed numbers, and he needed them fast.

He turned to the Iron Fangs, a rebel Hunter guild that had been waging a losing war against the Association for years. They were strong, unpredictable, but most importantly, they *hated* Kain. Convincing them to follow him was no small feat. Instead of brute force, he appealed to their vendetta, offering them the war they had always wanted.

#### **Game Decision:**
- **Option 1:** Duel The Alpha in one-on-one combat to earn the Fangs’ respect.
- **Option 2:** Offer tactical support and resources to prove leadership without unnecessary bloodshed.

With the Iron Fangs at his back, Joel made his next move: uncovering Kain’s secret weapon. Naomi’s research led them to Project NOX, a bioweapon program designed to mass-produce evolved super-Hunters. If Kain succeeded, the war would be over before it even began.

### **Chapter Three: The Fall of Project NOX**

Joel and his team infiltrated Blacksite Omega-2, the hidden facility where Project NOX was being developed. Rather than fight their way in, they used underground waste tunnels to slip inside undetected. But the deeper they went, the more horrors they uncovered.

In the forgotten sublevels, they found something even worse than NOX—*prisoners*. Hunters twisted into experiments, abandoned when they failed to meet Kain’s expectations. Among them was a towering man with glowing veins, a woman with blackened eyes and an unsettling smile, a broken Hunter begging for death, and a silent child who *knew too much*.

#### **Game Decision:**
- **Option 1:** Free the prisoners and recruit them into the fight.
- **Option 2:** End their suffering to prevent unpredictable outcomes.

As alarms blared, they planted explosives throughout the facility. With one push of a detonator, Blacksite Omega-2 collapsed into fire and rubble. Project NOX was gone.

### **Chapter Four: Siege on the King**

With Kain’s empire cracking, Joel launched his final assault.

A full-scale siege was his answer—surround the fortress, choke off all escape routes, and crush Kain’s forces piece by piece. Iron Fang warriors blocked every exit, snipers took their positions, and the rescued experiments stood ready for battle.

#### **Game Decision:**
- **Option 1:** Disable power defenses before attacking.
- **Option 2:** Charge in full force, taking immediate control of key points.

Then, in the chaos, Joel led his team to Kain’s command center.

### **Chapter Five: The Final Confrontation**

Kain stood at the center, watching with cold amusement. His body pulsed with unnatural energy, his veins glowing red. He had injected himself with his own experiments—one last, desperate grasp at power.

#### **Game Decision:**
- **Option 1:** Exploit Kain’s over-reliance on predictions.
- **Option 2:** Use the environment to collapse part of the facility on him.

A precise blow to the injection site shattered his control over his power. As he collapsed, convulsing, Joel gave him no final words. He drove his blade through Kain’s heart and ended it.

**The legend of Joel had only just begun.**
